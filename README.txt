The assignment (not the extra credit part) files are in the normal folder. Extra credit code files are in the EC folder

I ran the java file on Intellij. However, I had to download and use the mySQL connector that can be found on the website.
I don't know how exactly you would execute from the command line

To call queries with the java file edit the executequery("3") line in the main statment. Commands should be written with a number reffering to the query 
number in the CAP database. If the query is dynamic query, you can change the default input by seperating the number with a space and the new field.
(Ex. 1 "Jerray"), which will get the products ordered by agent Jerray instead of Jenny Doe.

EC:

I have included the files I was attempting to use for the extra credit. However, I was unable to succesfully complete the extra credit assignment.
If you can tell me where I went wrong, that would be nice :).
